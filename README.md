# Gamsick website

## ♢ The problem that we solved:

When we need to search about gaming news or details, we would want to hear music of some kinds, so we would use another app to listen to them.
But in this web app, we solved this problem and joined the gaming news with music section to hear them.

## ♢ Figma Design
Check out the figma design from [**HERE**](https://www.figma.com/file/bJPqD74cqoKSb64Yzre5T5/team7?node-id=0%3A1).

## ♢ The solution we applied:

In this app, we divided the functionality between two sections: *Gaming News Section* and *Music Section*.

- In the ***Gaming Section***, we toke the picture of the game, the title, the description, the platform, the developer, and the release date. There's more than four hundred games collected from more than five categories to give the user all the kinds and types of games that he is interested in under one single click.

- In the ***Music Section***, we putted some songs for some artists that the gamer loves to hear to, those artists like: Eminem, Topac Shakur, Jay-Z, Drake, and Snop Dog.
By that, the user is able to listen to his favorite music and read the data about the game that he needs to know about under the same roof.
